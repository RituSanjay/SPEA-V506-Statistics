-> With a random sample or a randomized experiment, th eprobability an observation has a particular outcomes is
th eproportion of times that outcome would occur in a very long sequence of observations

-> Probabilities can be experessed as proportions (0 - 1) or percentages

-> Basic probability rules:
 1) P(not A)=1-P(A)
 2) P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B)// A and B are distinct possible outcomes
 3) P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B given A)
 4) P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)  // A and B are independent

-> A random variable refers to a variable for which the value from observation to 
observation can vary according to random variation summarized by probabilities

-> A probability distribution lists possible variable outcomes and their associtaed probabilites

-> For a discrete variable , the prob dist assigns a possible value between 0 and 1

-> For a continuous variable, the prob dist assigns probabilities to intervals of numbers

-> The mean of a discrete probability distribution is mu=sum( y*P(y) )

-> The normal distribution describes how many continuous values are distributed.
 It is symmetric, bell-shaped, and charecterized by its mean standard distribution.

-> For each z (std dev away from mean) we can find the probability from the right-tail 
probability table.

-> Sample distribution and sampling distribution are both different concepts.

->  A sampling distribution of a statistic is the probability distribution that specifies
probabilities for the possible values the statistica can take.

-> Each sample statistic such as meadian, mean, proportion etc has a sampling distribution

-> Central Limit Theorem : The random sampling with a  large size of N, the sampling distribution
of the sample mean  y-bar will center about a given population mean regardless of wherther the 
population itself is normally distributed or not
