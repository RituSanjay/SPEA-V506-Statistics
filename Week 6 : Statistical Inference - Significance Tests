-> If a population parameter has a certain value, thn the corresponding sample statistic should fall 
within a certain range.

-> Elements if a significance test :
 1) Assumptions
 2) Hypotheses
 3) Test-statistics
 4) p-values
 5) conclusions

-> Assumptions involve:
 1) the type of data - quantitative vs qualitative
 2) the form pf population distribution
 3) sampling method
 4) sample size

-> Hypothese:
 1) The null hypothesis(H0) is ususally a statement that 
the parameter has a value corresponding to no effect.
We want to test if H)is true.
 2) The alternative hypothesis(Ha) is usually a statement
that the parameter has some alternative set of values to
what the null hypothesis specifies.
 3) In a significance test we analyze whetether 
we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
the alternative hypothesis is true.

-> The test statistic is calculated from teh samplr
data to test the null hypohesis. This statistic ususally involves a
point estimate of the paraeter to which the hypothesis refer.

-> The p-value is the probability , when H0 is true, of a test 
statistic being at least as contradictory to H0 as the value actually
observed. The smaller the p-value, the more stringly the data contadict H0

-> to reject H0 we need p-value<0.05

-> Type-1 error : H0 is true but we reject it
   Type-2 error : H0 is false but we do not reject it

-> Rejecting the nullhypothesis at a given alpha
is equivalent to the confidance interval for the mean mu 
with the same error probability not containing the
null hypothesis value
