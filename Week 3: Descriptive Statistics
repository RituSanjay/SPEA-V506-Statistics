-> To describe quantitative data:
   - find the center of data
   - find the variability of the data from the center
   
-> To describe catagorical data we use measures of relative frequency : the proportion or percentage of the observations
that fall into this catagory.

-> A frequency distribution is a listing for the possible values of a variable, together with the number of obsrvations at each value.

-> A relative frequency distribution table lists the possible values together with their proportions or percentages. 

-> Frequency distributions and historams can be used to describe population-level data (called population distributions) and
and to data-sampled-from-population (called sample-data distribution).

-> Mean = sum/ number of observations

-> Mean can be highly influenced by outliers

-> Median : the observation that falls directly in the middle of an ordered observation

-> When the distribution is skewed, the median gives a better indication.

-> To find the median :
 1) when the sample size is odd, the middle value i sthe median when arranged in asc or desc 
 2) when the sample size id even, there are two middle values and the median will be the midpoint 
between these two values

-> When the distribution is highly skewed the median descibes abetter value than the mean.

-> The median is appropriate for quantitative and ordinal-scale qualitative variables, not nomial-scale variables

-> The mode is the value that occurs most frequently an dis used for describing highly discrete data.
Mode can be used for both qualitative and quantitative data.

-> The range is the difference between the smallest and largest value in a data.

-> The standard deviation is based on deviations of data from the measure of center like the mean. The deviation 
is spositive when the observation falls above the mean, negative when it falls below the mean.

-> The sum of deviations around the mean eual zero. Because of this, the most popular measure of variability 
is the absolute values of the deviations or the square of the deviations.

-> Emperical rule for interpreting standard deviation:
 1) about 68% of observations fall between (mean+sd) and (mean-sd)
 2) About 95% of the observation sfall between (mean +/- 2sd)
 3) All or nearly all observations fall bewteen (mean +/- 3sd)
   // applies only to bell shaped distributions

-> Standard deviation is heavily influenced by outliers especially in small datasets.

-> If the smallest or largest value in the dataset is smaller than the standard deviation, 
it shows that the distribution is severly skewed.

-> The pth percentile is the point such that p% ob the observations fall below or at that point.
25th percentile is called the lower quartile and 75th percentile is the upper quartile.

-> Difference between the median and the upper quartile and the distance between the median
and the lower quartile can indicate if the distribution is skewed if the difference between 
both the differences is large.

-> For bell shaped distributions, the distance from mean to either quartile is approximtely 2/3 of a standard deviation.

-> The number of standard deviations that an observation falls from the mean is called z-score.
An analysis of association between two variables is called bivariate analysis. One variable is called response or outcome 
or dependent variable while the other is called exploratory or independent variable.

->The sample means and SD are variables because they depend on the sample selected from th epopulation; the
population mean and SD are constants.
