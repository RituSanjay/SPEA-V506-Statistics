-> To describe quantitative data:
   - find the center of data
   - find the variability of the data from the center
   
-> To describe catagorical data we use measures of relative frequency : the proportion or percentage of the observations
that fall into this catagory.

-> A frequency distribution is a listing for the possible values of a variable, together with the number of obsrvations at each value.

-> A relative frequency distribution table lists the possible values together with their proportions or percentages. 

-> Frequency distributions and historams can be used to describe population-level data (called population distributions) and
and to data-sampled-from-population (called sample-data distribution).

-> Mean = sum/ number of observations

-> Mean can be highly influenced by outliers

-> Median : the observation that falls directly in the middle of an ordered observation

-> When the distribution is skewed, the median gives a better indication.
