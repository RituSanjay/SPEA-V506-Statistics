-> Point estimate : a singke estimate of a population parameter

-> Interval estimate : range of numbers around the point estimate, within which
the parater is believed to fall (gauges accuracy of point estimate)

-> ^ is used to denote parameter estimate

-> confidance inreval describe point estimate accuracy

-> If the sampling distribution is approximately normal, by the
 central limit theorwem, as n increases, the sampling distribution
approximates the normal distribution), we can apply the
emperical rule.

-> Confidence coefficient : the probability that the confidence
interval contains the parameter

-> The error probability is denoted by 'alpha'
