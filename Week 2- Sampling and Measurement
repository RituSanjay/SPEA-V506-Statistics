-> A variable is a charecteristic that can vary in value among subjects in a sample or a population

-> Measurement scale is the range of values taken on by a variable

-> Variables can be of two types :
   1) Quantitative : measurement scale is numeric
   2) Catagorical (qualitative) : measurement scale is a set of catagories (can be ordered or unordered)

-> Nominal, ordinal and interval scales of measurement :
   1) quantitative variables are measured on an interval scale ( there is an equal distance between each scale)
   2) qualitative variables are ordinal or nominal
      i) nominal - no implicit ranking eg. ice cream flavors
      ii) ordinal - implicit ranking eg. social class
      
-> Discrete and continuous variables :
   1) Discrete : may take values that form a set of seperate numbers, such as 0,1,2,3....
   2) Continuous : may take values among the infinite continuum of of possible real number values
   
-> The statistical method used to analyze data depends on whether the variable is quantitative vs qualitative, 
   or discrete vs continuous
