-> A variable is a charecteristic that can vary in value among subjects in a sample or a population

-> Measurement scale is the range of values taken on by a variable

-> Variables can be of two types :
   1) Quantitative : measurement scale is numeric
   2) Catagorical (qualitative) : measurement scale is a set of catagories (can be ordered or unordered)

-> Nominal, ordinal and interval scales of measurement :
   1) quantitative variables are measured on an interval scale ( there is an equal distance between each scale)
   2) qualitative variables are ordinal or nominal
      i) nominal - no implicit ranking eg. ice cream flavors
      ii) ordinal - implicit ranking eg. social class
      
-> Discrete and continuous variables :
   1) Discrete : may take values that form a set of seperate numbers, such as 0,1,2,3....
   2) Continuous : may take values among the infinite continuum of of possible real number values
   
-> The statistical method used to analyze data depends on whether the variable is quantitative vs qualitative, 
   or discrete vs continuous
   
-> The quality of any inferance made depends on how well the sample represents the population.

-> A simple random sample of n objects from a population is one in which each possible sample of that size has the same probability 
of being chosen.

-> Random numbers are numbers generated by the computer according to a scheme where each digit can be chosen from 0,1,2,....9
irrespective of the previously chosen number.

-> How to select a simple random sample ?
   -List all the subjects in the population. This list is called the sampling form.
   -Number the subjects in the sampling frame.
   -Generate a set of the numbers randomly.
   -Sample the subjects whose numbers were generated, making sure each subject has an equal chance of being chosen.

-> Simple random sampling can be used for :
   - random assignment
   - random selection

-> The sampling error of a statistic equals the error that occurs when we use a statistic from sample to predict a population parameter.

-> Sampling Error = true Population Parameter - Sample statistic (usually not known)

-> Margin of error is usually taken as +/- 3%.

-> In probability sampling, the probability of a subject being chosen is known.

-> In nonprobability sampling, the probability of a subject being chosen is not known; is of two types : volunteer and convinience.
Nonprobability sampling can cause a sampling bias.

-> Response bias occurs when the response of sample ubjects is incorrect.

-> Nonresponse bias occurs when the participants in a survey refuse to answer or cannot be reached.

->Systematic random sampling involves choosing a number after a 'skip'.

-> How to select a systematic random sample?
   - Denote the sample size by n and the population size by N.
   - Let k=N/n
   - A systematic random sample :
      - selects a subject at random from the first k names in the sampling frame.
      - Selects every kth subject listed after that one.
      - The number k is calle dthe skip number.
      
 -> Stratified random sampling divides the population intoseperate groups called strata and then selects a 
 simple random sample from each stratum.
 
 -> Types of stratified random sampling:
    - Proportional : groups are sampled in proportion with their overall population representations
    - Disproportional : where you may over-sample if some strata have smaller population
    
 -> Cluster sampling involves dividing the population of interest into numerous clusters, the samples are then drawn from these clusters
 (simple random sampling).
