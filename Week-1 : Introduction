      * surveys
      * experiments
      * direct observation
   2) Secondary Souces - obtained from a third party
      * public-use data (census)
      * administrative datasets

   Data can have any 'unit of analysis' meaning that the records of a dataset may pertain to a single individual (/object/event etc) or a
   group of individuals (/objects/events etc), like a household.
-> Statistics consists of a body of methods for obtaining and analysing data.
